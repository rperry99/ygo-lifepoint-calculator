# Yu-Gi-Oh Lifepoint Tracker

This is a lifepoint tracker that can take all the math out of playing the tabletop Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game.

This project was done using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

The point of this project was mostly to get some practice in using jQuery and some regular JavaScript.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a Timer
- Add a Coin Flipper
- Add a Die roller
- Add a win tracker
